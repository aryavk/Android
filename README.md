Game Play

This is a "space invaders" style game. Variable movement of opponents at the top of the screen you need to hit with the ball. 

To play, tap the left and right buttons at the bottom left of the button pane to move your avatar. Press the shoot button on the bottom right of the button pane to shoot a ball.

If a ball collides with an opponents ball, it will destroy it, and you can shoot again. Each person can only have 1 ball on the screen at any given time. If your ball collides with the opponent it will remove the opponent from that level. Once all opponents are removed from the level you win that level and go to the next level.

If an opponents ball collides with the player it is the end of the game.

Scoring is calculated as follows:

5 points for each opponent hit
5 * level for each level won.
